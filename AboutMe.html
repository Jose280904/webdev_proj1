	<h2>Hobbies</h2>
	<p>I have a strong passion for cars and really enjoy working on my own. I have gotten the chance and do some upgrades on my car. Here is an image showing how my car is sitting now!</p>

	<p>I also enjoy listening to music a lot because it can get me through a lot by making me productive. Music helps me with homework and even working on my car as mentioned before. Here you can listen to one of my favorite artist, Junior H.</p>
